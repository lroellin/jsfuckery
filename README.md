This page is dedicated to sharing your favorite JS fuckeries. Stuff you find weird or needs a bit of an explanation, can be shared here.

# How to contribute

This page is built on Hugo, a static site generator. If you're already familiar with it, good on you! If not, you won't need much of an introduction

You can contribute in two ways:

## Simple contribution

1. Fork this repo
2. Add a file to `content/fuckery`, you can copy one of the existing ones
3. Change the *front matter*, the stuff at the top between the three dashes (`---`)
4. Open a pull request to my repo

## Hugo-connaisseur contribution

1. Clone this repo
2. Make a new post: `hugo new fuckery/<title>.md`
3. Open your file created in `/content/fuckery`
4. Change the *front matter*, the stuff at the top between the three dashes (`---`)
5. Check how this page looks with `hugo server`
6. Commit, push, open a pull request to my repo

# In case it's not clear

This is a satirical website. I do not encourage you to write JS like this, and if used correctly, it's actually a nice language ðŸ˜‰
